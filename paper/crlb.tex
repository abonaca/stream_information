\begin{abstract}\noindent % trust me
Cold stellar streams---produced by tidal disruptions of globular
clusters (or equivalent)---are long-lived, coherent dynamical features
in the stellar halo of the Milky Way.
They have delivered precise information about the mass distribution or
gravitational potential, including constraints on the shape of the
dark-matter halo.
Because of their different positions in phase space, different ages,
and different levels of observational scrutiny, different streams tell
us different things about the Galaxy.
Here we employ a Cram\'er--Rao (\CRLB) or Fisher-matrix approach to
understand the quantitative information content in the known
streams (Pal5, GD-1, Styx, [full list here]).
This approach depends on the existence of a generative model of
stellar streams, which we have developed previously, and which permits
easy calculation of derivatives of predicted stream properties with
respect to Galaxy model parameters.
We find that, in simple, static, analytic models of the Milky Way,
streams XX and YY contain the most information about the dark-matter
shape.
For any individual stream, there are near-degeneracies between
dark-matter halo properties and other parameters, including the mass
of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the total dark-matter mass, and other
potential parameters, but we find that simultaneous fitting of multiple
streams ought to precisely constrain all parameters well.
The \CRLB\ on any one parameter depends strongly on the model freedom;
as we permit more potential freedom, the information about, say, halo
triaxiality, reduces.
We perform experiments to demonstrate this using potential basis
functions that permit great freedom in the gravitational potential on intermediate
scales.
The \CRLB\ formalism also permits us to assess the value of future
measurements of stellar velocities, distances, and proper motions. We
make some comments about the information value of various new
observations that could be made of particular known streams.

\caption{Two-dimensional Cram\' er--Rao lower bounds that cold stellar streams put on parameters of the Milky Way dark matter halo.
Parameters considered are the halo scale velocity $V_h$, scale radius $R_h$, $x/y$ and $z/y$ axis ratios $q_1$ and $q_z$, respectively.
Parameter combination is the same across the rows.
Bounds based on individual streams (GD-1, Pal~5, Triangulum and ATLAS) are shown in the first four columns, and their combination is presented in the last column.
The ellipse color denotes the dimensionality of the observational data used to calculate the bound; the darkest ellipses are based on positional information only, medium-colored ellipses include positions and radial velocity, and the lightest ellipses are derived using the full 6-D phase space of streams.
Not all streams are equally constraining for all of the parameters, but for a given stream, parameter constraints improve when more phase-space dimensions are included.
Combining different streams results in the most precise recovery of the halo parameters.
Even if only limited observational data is available for multiple streams, the obtained bounds are comparable to, or better than, the best bounds coming from any individual stream.
